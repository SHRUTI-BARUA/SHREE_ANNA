#Shreanna Connect – Project Overview

Shreanna Connect is a web application built to bring farmers and consumers closer together.
The idea is simple: many farmers, especially small millet farmers, don’t get fair prices because they depend heavily on middlemen. At the same time, consumers rarely get direct access to genuine, good-quality farm products.

Shreanna Connect creates a space where farmers can sell their produce and millet-based value-added products directly to consumers, with the support of FPOs (Farmer Producer Organizations) and SHGs (Self Help Groups). These groups help with verification, quality checks, and logistics so the process stays organized and trustworthy.

This platform is being developed as part of our Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project.


#Why This Project Matters

-Farmers often face issues like:

-Not getting fair prices

-No direct market access

-Difficulty promoting their products

-Low visibility for millet-based items

At the same time, consumers want fresher, healthier food and want to know where it comes from.

Shreanna Connect tries to solve both sides of the problem.


#What Shreanna Connect Does

Our platform works like a simple, farmer-friendly online marketplace. It allows:

-Farmers to register, upload products, set prices, and track sales

-FPOs and SHGs to help organize farmers, support logistics, and make sure product quality stays high

-Consumers to browse and buy directly from verified farmers

By removing unnecessary middlemen, the system becomes more transparent and fair for everyone.
